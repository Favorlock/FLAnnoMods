# Traders Spawn With White Flag

Trade ships will spawn with a white flag equipped. By default ships are equipped with a standard white flag item. If desired you can change the type of flag individually for each ship type or disable them altogether. This gives you a variety of options for changing your game experience. It's highly recommended to use iModYourAnno mod manager.

Flag GUIDs:

- White Flag - 191878 (Default)
- Great White Flag - 191991

## Features

- iModYourAnno tweak support:
    - Individual configuration of ships: Schooner, Clipper, Cargo Ship, Extravaganza Steamer, Great Eastern, and the World-Class Reefer!
    - Choose between the White Flag or the Great White Flag for your ships.


## Issues

- Breaks destroy and escort quests (trade ships) as these ships will spawn with a white flag. Currently unsure if it's possible or not limit the situations when a white flag is spawned since this mod works by overriding the ship assets.
